Here’s a summary of **reasons to use DynamoDB** compared to traditional architecture and other NoSQL databases, based on the slides:

---

### **Traditional Architecture (RDBMS)**

* Uses **relational databases** (like MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* Requires fixed schemas and supports SQL queries, joins, and aggregations.
* Scaling is mostly **vertical** (buying bigger servers) and sometimes **horizontal** (read replicas).
* Good for complex relationships and transactional data, but not optimized for massive, distributed, or variable workloads.

### **NoSQL Databases**

* **NoSQL** is non-relational and designed for distributed, horizontally scalable environments.
* Examples include **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**.
* Don’t support joins or complex aggregations.
* Ideal when all required data is stored in a single item/row.
* Great for massive scale and rapid, flexible development.

### **Why Use Amazon DynamoDB?**

* **Fully Managed & Serverless:** No infrastructure to manage; AWS handles scaling, replication, and backups.
* **Highly Available:** Automatic replication across multiple Availability Zones.
* **Massive Scalability:** Handles millions of requests per second, trillions of rows, and hundreds of TBs.
* **Consistent Low Latency:** Fast performance for real-time workloads.
* **Integrated Security:** IAM-based access, encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Event-driven:** Integrates with DynamoDB Streams for real-time triggers (e.g., AWS Lambda).
* **Auto-scaling:** Automatically adjusts to workload changes.
* **Flexible Data Model:** Schema-less, supports key-value and document data.
* **Low Cost:** Pay for what you use, no need to over-provision resources.
* **Global Tables:** Multi-region, fully replicated, and high performance.

#### **Real World Example**

If you build a mobile gaming backend, you need a database that can instantly scale for millions of players worldwide, remain highly available, and provide consistent performance—**without any server maintenance**. DynamoDB is ideal in this situation.

### **Key Slide Points**

* “Fully managed, highly available with replication across multiple AZs”
* “Scales to massive workloads, distributed database”
* “Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of rows, 100s of TB of storage”
* “Fast and consistent in performance (low latency on retrieval)”
* “Enables event driven programming with DynamoDB Streams”
* “Low cost and auto-scaling capabilities”

---

**In summary:**
Use DynamoDB for serverless, scalable, high-performance, and low-maintenance requirements—especially when your app needs to handle massive scale and real-time data without the overhead and rigidity of traditional RDBMS.
