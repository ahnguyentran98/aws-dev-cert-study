# Lecture: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

### What is ACM?
AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS resources. Think of it as your certificate management automation tool.

### Core Features
**Certificate Management:**
- Easily provision SSL/TLS certificates
- Used to provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
- Supports both public and private TLS certificates
- **Free of charge for public TLS certificates**
- **Automatic TLS certificate renewal** - no more expired certificates!

### SSL/TLS Background
**What are SSL/TLS Certificates?**
- **SSL** = Secure Sockets Layer (older standard)
- **TLS** = Transport Layer Security (newer, current standard)
- People still say "SSL" but we mainly use TLS certificates today
- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA) like Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign

### ACM Integration Points
**AWS Services that Use ACM:**
- **Elastic Load Balancers** (ALB, NLB, CLB)
- **Amazon CloudFront** distributions
- **API Gateway** APIs

### Architecture Example
```
Users → HTTPS (ACM Certificate) → Application Load Balancer → HTTP → EC2 Instances
```

The load balancer terminates SSL/TLS using ACM certificates, then forwards unencrypted traffic to EC2 instances in the private network.

### Key Benefits
**Operational Simplicity:**
- No manual certificate renewal
- Automatic deployment to integrated services
- Centralized certificate management

**Cost Effectiveness:**
- Public certificates are completely free
- No hidden charges for renewals

**Security:**
- AWS manages the private keys securely
- Integration with AWS security services

## AWS Private Certificate Authority (CA)

### What is AWS Private CA?
AWS Private CA is a managed service that allows you to create your own private Certificate Authorities, including root and subordinate CAs for your organization.

### Key Concepts
**Certificate Authority Types:**
- **Root CA** - The top-level authority that issues certificates
- **Subordinate CA** - Secondary authorities that derive trust from root CA
- **End-entity X.509 certificates** - The actual certificates for devices/applications

### Trust Model
**Private vs Public Certificates:**
- **Private certificates** are trusted only by your organization (not the public Internet)
- **Public certificates** are trusted globally by browsers and systems
- Private CA creates certificates for internal use only

### Use Cases
**Enterprise Security:**
- **Encrypted TLS communication** within organization
- **Code signing** for internal applications
- **Device authentication** for computers, API endpoints, IoT devices
- **User authentication** for corporate systems
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** for large enterprises

### AWS Service Integration
**Works with ACM-Integrated Services:**
- EKS (Kubernetes clusters)
- Elastic Load Balancers
- API Gateway
- CloudFront

### Architecture Example
```
AWS Private CA → Issues Certificates → User Computers, APIs, IoT Devices
                ↓
           Integrates with EKS, ELB, API Gateway, CloudFront
```

### Benefits
**Managed PKI:**
- No need to manage complex PKI infrastructure
- AWS handles CA operations and security
- Automatic certificate lifecycle management

**Enterprise Grade:**
- Suitable for large organizations with complex security requirements
- Compliance with enterprise security standards
- Integration with existing AWS security services

**Cost Control:**
- Pay only for certificates issued
- No upfront infrastructure costs
- Scales with your needs

### Comparison: ACM vs Private CA

**ACM (Public Certificates):**
- Free public certificates
- Automatic renewal
- Internet-trusted
- Great for public websites

**Private CA:**
- Organization-only trust
- Enterprise PKI
- Internal applications
- Complete control over certificate chain

**Real-world Example:** A large enterprise uses AWS Private CA to issue certificates for all internal applications, IoT devices, and employee computers, ensuring secure communication within the organization while maintaining complete control over their PKI infrastructure.
