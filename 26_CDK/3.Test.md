## CDK Unit Testing Summary

### Testing Framework
- Uses **CDK Assertions Module** with Jest (JavaScript) or Pytest (Python)
- Tests infrastructure code before deployment to catch bugs early

### Two Types of Tests:

**1. Fine-grained Assertions (Most Common)**
- Test specific CloudFormation template aspects
- Verify resource properties, security configs, resource counts
- Example: Check if S3 bucket has encryption enabled

**2. Snapshot Tests**
- Compare entire template against stored baseline
- Detect any unexpected infrastructure changes
- Good for catching breaking changes during refactoring

### Template Import:
- `Template.fromStack(MyStack)` - for CDK-built stacks
- `Template.fromString(mystring)` - for external CloudFormation

### Real-world Benefits:
- **Security validation** - ensure resources follow best practices
- **Regression prevention** - catch configuration changes
- **CI/CD integration** - automated testing in deployment pipelines
- **Team confidence** - safe refactoring and collaboration

### Common Test Scenarios:
- Resource existence and properties
- IAM policies and security groups
- Encryption and compliance settings
- Cost optimization (ARM architecture, billing modes)

CDK testing ensures your Infrastructure as Code is reliable, secure, and maintainable before AWS deployment.
