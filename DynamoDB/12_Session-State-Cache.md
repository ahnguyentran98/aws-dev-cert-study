# DynamoDB as Session State Cache

Using DynamoDB to store session state is a common pattern, especially for serverless architectures. Hereâ€™s how it compares to other AWS storage options:

## DynamoDB vs. Other Session State Solutions

- **ElastiCache**
  - In-memory, extremely low latency.
  - DynamoDB is serverless, scales automatically, and persists data.
  - Both are key/value stores, but ElastiCache is best for ultra-fast, ephemeral caching.

- **EFS (Elastic File System)**
  - Must be attached to EC2 instances as a network drive.
  - DynamoDB is accessed via API, no mounting required, and is fully managed.

- **EBS & Instance Store**
  - Only suitable for local caching on a single EC2 instance.
  - Not shared across multiple instances or services.

- **S3**
  - Higher latency, designed for large objects and bulk storage.
  - Not optimized for small, frequent session state reads/writes.

**Summary:**  
DynamoDB is a great choice for session state caching in serverless and distributed applications, offering scalability, durability, and easy integration.
