## AWS CI/CD Overview

### What You'll Learn

**Core AWS CI/CD Services:**
- **AWS CodeCommit** - Source code repository service for storing and managing code
- **AWS CodePipeline** - Orchestration service for automating your entire CI/CD workflow
- **AWS CodeBuild** - Fully managed build service for compiling, testing, and packaging code
- **AWS CodeDeploy** - Automated deployment service for applications to various compute services
- **AWS CodeStar** - Integrated development environment for managing CI/CD projects
- **AWS CodeArtifact** - Package management service for storing and sharing software artifacts
- **AWS CodeGuru** - AI-powered code review and performance optimization service

### Key Concepts You'll Master

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Developers frequently push code to repositories
- Automated testing and building occurs on every code push
- Early bug detection and faster feedback loops
- Integration with build servers for automated validation

**Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
- Automated deployment pipelines for reliable software releases
- Shift from infrequent large releases to frequent small deployments
- Automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Multiple deployment strategies (blue/green, rolling, canary)

### Technology Stack Architecture

The lessons cover how these services work together:
- **Source Stage**: CodeCommit or GitHub for code storage
- **Build Stage**: CodeBuild for compilation and testing
- **Deploy Stage**: CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, or ECS for deployment
- **Orchestration**: CodePipeline to connect and automate all stages

### Deployment Strategies You'll Learn

**CodeDeploy Deployment Types:**
- **In-place deployments** - Update existing instances
- **Blue/Green deployments** - Create new environment, then switch traffic
- **Rolling deployments** - Gradual updates (AllAtOnce, HalfAtATime, OneAtATime)
- **Canary deployments** - Test with small percentage before full rollout

### Platform Coverage

**Deployment Targets:**
- EC2 instances and on-premises servers
- AWS Lambda functions with traffic shifting
- ECS services with task definition updates
- Auto Scaling Groups with automated scaling

### Advanced Topics

**Integration and Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch Events/EventBridge for pipeline monitoring
- CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- IAM roles and policies for secure access
- S3 for artifact storage and caching
- Manual approval stages for controlled releases

### Real-World Implementation Focus

The lessons emphasize practical scenarios like:
- Automating deployment from development to production environments
- Setting up multi-stage pipelines (dev → test → staging → prod)
- Implementing proper testing and validation at each stage
- Managing deployment rollbacks and failure scenarios
- Integrating with existing development workflows

This comprehensive CI/CD coverage prepares you for the AWS Developer Associate exam by focusing on automation, deployment best practices, and the interconnected nature of AWS developer services in modern software delivery pipelines.
