* **Small Applications / Reducing Source Code Complexity:** For simpler applications, API Gateway can:
    * Provide a secure HTTP endpoint for serverless functions (Lambda). [cite_start]This means your application code doesn't need to handle complex HTTP request parsing, response formatting, or authentication logic, as API Gateway can take care of these aspects (especially with Lambda Proxy Integration). [cite: 696]
    * [cite_start]Offload static content serving, by integrating with S3 buckets for static website hosting, which simplifies the application backend. [cite: 227]
    * [cite_start]Handle basic request validation, preventing malformed requests from even reaching your backend code. [cite: 702]
    * [cite_start]Implement caching for frequently accessed data, reducing the load on your backend and improving response times without you having to write caching logic in your application. [cite: 704]

* **Microservices Architecture:** This is where API Gateway truly shines and is a core component. It allows you to:
    * [cite_start]**Create a Single Interface:** Clients interact with one API Gateway endpoint, which then intelligently routes requests to various backend microservices (e.g., different Lambda functions, ECS services, or other HTTP endpoints), abstracting the complexity of your distributed system from the client. [cite: 726]
    * [cite_start]**Centralize Security:** Implement authentication and authorization (IAM, Cognito, Lambda Authorizers) consistently across all your microservices at the API Gateway layer, rather than having each microservice manage its own security. [cite: 714, 716, 717]
    * [cite_start]**Manage API Versions and Environments:** Use stages to manage different versions (v1, v2) and environments (dev, test, prod) of your microservices APIs seamlessly. [cite: 690, 691]
    * [cite_start]**Handle Traffic Management:** Apply throttling and usage plans to protect your microservices from being overwhelmed and to meter API usage for different consumers. [cite: 706]
    * [cite_start]**Enable Real-time Communication:** Provide WebSocket APIs for interactive, real-time features like chat or live data updates, which are common in modern microservices. [cite: 720]

* **Support to Reduce Backend Complexity:** Regardless of application size, API Gateway can reduce complexity on the backend by:
    * **Decoupling Clients from Backend:** Clients interact only with the API Gateway, not directly with potentially volatile backend service IPs or configurations.
    * [cite_start]**Transforming Requests/Responses:** It can adapt API calls between the client and backend formats (e.g., JSON to XML, or simple query parameters to complex backend payloads), reducing the need for this logic in your backend services. [cite: 698, 699]
    * [cite_start]**Monitoring and Troubleshooting:** Provides centralized logging and tracing for all API interactions, making it easier to monitor performance and debug issues across your distributed system. [cite: 708, 709]
