# CloudWatch Logs Encryption Lecture

## Overview of CloudWatch Logs Encryption

CloudWatch Logs supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) keys. This provides an additional layer of security for your log data stored in CloudWatch Logs.

### Default Encryption
- **Logs are encrypted by default** with AWS managed encryption
- **Optional KMS encryption** using your own Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)
- **Encryption occurs at the log group level**, not individual log streams

## How to Enable KMS Encryption

### Console Limitation
**Important**: You **cannot** associate a KMS key with a log group using the CloudWatch console. This is a key limitation to remember for the exam.

### API-Only Configuration
You must use the **CloudWatch Logs API** to enable KMS encryption. There are two main scenarios:

#### 1. For Existing Log Groups
**API Command**: `associate-kms-key`
- Use this when you already have a log group created
- Associates a KMS key with an existing log group
- All new log events will be encrypted with the specified key

#### 2. For New Log Groups  
**API Command**: `create-log-group`
- Use this when creating a new log group
- Specify the KMS key during creation
- All log events will be encrypted from the start

## Encryption Architecture

### How It Works
```
Application → CloudWatch Logs → Log Group (with KMS Key) → Encrypted Storage
                                      ↓
                                 KMS Key (CMK)
                                      ↓
                              Encrypted Log Data
```

### Key Components
- **Log Group**: Container for log streams, where encryption is configured
- **KMS Key**: Customer Managed Key used for encryption/decryption
- **IAM Permissions**: Required for CloudWatch Logs to use the KMS key

## Required Permissions

### KMS Key Policy
The KMS key must allow CloudWatch Logs service to use it:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:Encrypt",
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:ReEncrypt*",
    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
    "kms:Describe*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### IAM Permissions
Users/roles need permissions to associate KMS keys:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "logs:AssociateKmsKey",
    "logs:CreateLogGroup"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Creating Encrypted Log Group
```bash
# AWS CLI example
aws logs create-log-group \
  --log-group-name /my-application/prod \
  --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

### Adding Encryption to Existing Log Group
```bash
# AWS CLI example
aws logs associate-kms-key \
  --log-group-name /my-application/prod \
  --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

## Use Cases and Benefits

### When to Use KMS Encryption
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meeting regulatory requirements for log encryption
- **Sensitive Application Logs**: Applications logging PII or financial data
- **Security Best Practices**: Enhanced security posture for critical systems
- **Cross-Account Access Control**: Fine-grained access control through KMS policies

### Benefits
- **Data Protection**: Logs encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: KMS policies control who can decrypt logs
- **Audit Trail**: KMS usage logged in CloudTrail
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation capabilities

## Practical Considerations

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Latency**: KMS encryption adds minimal overhead
- **Throughput**: No significant impact on log ingestion rates
- **Cost**: Additional charges for KMS key usage

### Key Management
- **Customer Managed Keys**: Full control over key policies and rotation
- **Key Regions**: Keys must be in the same region as log groups
- **Key Deletion**: Careful planning needed - deleting keys makes logs unreadable

## Real-World Example

**E-commerce Application Logging Setup**:

```bash
# 1. Create KMS key for application logs
aws kms create-key \
  --description "CloudWatch Logs encryption for ecommerce app"

# 2. Create encrypted log group for production
aws logs create-log-group \
  --log-group-name /ecommerce/prod/application \
  --kms-key-id alias/cloudwatch-logs-key

# 3. Configure application to send logs to encrypted group
# Application code sends logs to /ecommerce/prod/application
```

**Compliance Scenario**: A healthcare application must encrypt all logs containing patient data. Using KMS encryption ensures HIPAA compliance while maintaining CloudWatch Logs functionality for monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Key Takeaway**: CloudWatch Logs encryption requires API-based configuration and provides enterprise-grade security for sensitive log data through KMS integration.
