# AWS KMS (Key Management Service) Lecture

## AWS KMS Overview
AWS KMS is a managed encryption service that handles encryption keys for your AWS resources. When you hear "encryption" in AWS, it's likely using KMS. It's fully integrated with IAM for authorization and seamlessly works with most AWS services like EBS, S3, and RDS. You can audit key usage through CloudTrail.

## KMS Key Types

### Symmetric Keys (AES-256)
- Single encryption key for both encrypt and decrypt operations
- Most AWS services use symmetric keys
- You never access the key directly - must call KMS API
- Default choice for most encryption needs

### Asymmetric Keys (RSA & ECC)
- Public/Private key pairs
- Public key is downloadable, private key stays protected
- Used for encryption outside AWS by users who can't call KMS API
- Supports encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify operations

## KMS Key Categories

### AWS Owned Keys
- Free to use
- Examples: SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB default keys
- Managed entirely by AWS

### AWS Managed Keys
- Free service keys with names like aws/rds or aws/ebs
- Automatic rotation every year
- Limited control but no cost

### Customer Managed Keys
- $1 per month cost
- Full control over key policies and rotation
- Can enable automatic rotation or do on-demand rotation

## KMS Key Policies

### Default Policy
- Created automatically if you don't specify one
- Gives complete access to root user (entire AWS account)
- Simple but broad permissions

### Custom Policy
- Define specific users and roles who can access the key
- Control who can administer the key
- Essential for cross-account access
- Similar to S3 bucket policies but mandatory for KMS

## KMS API Operations Summary
Key operations include:
- **GenerateDataKey**: Creates encryption keys for your data
- **Decrypt**: Decrypts your encrypted data
- **Encrypt**: Encrypts data directly (small data only)

## KMS Request Quotas
- **Symmetric Keys**: 5,500-30,000 requests/second (varies by region)
- **RSA Keys**: 500 requests/second
- **ECC Keys**: 300 requests/second

These quotas can impact services like S3 with SSE-KMS. You can request quota increases or use S3 Bucket Keys to reduce API calls by 99%.

**Simple Example**: When you upload a file to S3 with encryption, S3 calls KMS to get a data key, encrypts your file, and stores both the encrypted file and encrypted key. When you download, S3 calls KMS to decrypt the key, then decrypts your file.
