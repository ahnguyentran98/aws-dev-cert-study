Based on the AWS Security & Encryption lessons, here's a brief overview of what you'll learn:

## AWS Security & Encryption Overview

**Core Topics:**
- **Encryption Fundamentals** - Understanding different types of encryption (in-flight, at-rest, client-side)
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** - Central service for managing encryption keys across AWS services
- **Envelope Encryption** - Technique for encrypting large files using data keys
- **AWS Encryption SDK** - Library for implementing encryption in applications
- **Service-Specific Encryption** - How encryption works in S3, CloudWatch Logs, CodeBuild, and other services

**Key Services & Tools:**
- AWS KMS for key management
- Parameter Store for secure parameter storage
- Secrets Manager for credential management
- AWS Nitro Enclaves for isolated processing
- CloudWatch Logs encryption
- S3 encryption methods (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C)

**Learning Outcomes:**
You'll understand how to implement security best practices, manage encryption keys, secure data in transit and at rest, and integrate encryption into AWS services. The lessons focus on practical implementation patterns and real-world scenarios for securing applications and data in the cloud.

This topic is essential for the AWS Developer Associate exam as encryption and security are fundamental requirements for any cloud application.
