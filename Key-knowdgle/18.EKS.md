# Amazon EKS Summary

## **Core Concepts**

**What is Amazon EKS?**
- EKS = Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
- AWS managed service to launch and manage Kubernetes clusters
- Alternative to Amazon ECS with similar goals but different API
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

## **Key Characteristics**

**Cloud-Agnostic Platform**
- Kubernetes can be used across any cloud (Azure, GCP, on-premises)
- Ideal for companies already using Kubernetes and migrating to AWS
- Provides consistent API and tooling across environments

**Deployment Architecture**
- One EKS cluster per region for multi-region deployments
- Integrates with CloudWatch Container Insights for logs and metrics
- Supports both EC2 worker nodes and AWS Fargate for serverless containers

## **Node Types**

**Managed Node Groups**
- EKS creates and manages EC2 instances (nodes) for you
- Nodes are part of Auto Scaling Group managed by EKS
- Supports both On-Demand and Spot Instances
- Simplified node management and updates

**Self-Managed Nodes**
- You create nodes and register them to EKS cluster
- Managed by your own Auto Scaling Group
- Can use prebuilt Amazon EKS Optimized AMI
- Supports both On-Demand and Spot Instances
- More control but additional management overhead

**AWS Fargate**
- Serverless container option
- No maintenance or node management required
- Fully managed compute environment
- Pay only for resources used

## **Data Volumes Support**

**Storage Requirements**
- Must specify StorageClass manifest on EKS cluster
- Uses Container Storage Interface (CSI) compliant drivers

**Supported Storage Types**
- **Amazon EBS**: Block storage for single-instance access
- **Amazon EFS**: Shared file system (works with Fargate)
- **Amazon FSx for Lustre**: High-performance file system
- **Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP**: Enterprise file system

## **Network Architecture**

**VPC Integration**
- Deploys across multiple Availability Zones
- Uses both public and private subnets
- NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access
- Elastic Load Balancers for traffic distribution

**Service Types**
- **Public Service Load Balancer**: Internet-facing services
- **Private Service Load Balancer**: Internal services only
- Integration with AWS networking services

## **Use Cases**

**Migration Scenarios**
- Companies with existing Kubernetes deployments
- Moving from on-premises Kubernetes to AWS
- Multi-cloud Kubernetes strategy requiring portability

**Container Orchestration**
- Complex microservices architectures
- Applications requiring Kubernetes-specific features
- Teams with existing Kubernetes expertise

## **Integration with AWS Services**

**Monitoring and Logging**
- CloudWatch Container Insights for comprehensive monitoring
- Native integration with AWS logging services
- Performance metrics and operational insights

**Compute Options**
- Works with Amazon EC2 for traditional node-based deployments
- AWS Fargate integration for serverless containers
- Flexible compute model based on workload requirements

## **Comparison with ECS**

**When to Choose EKS**
- Existing Kubernetes expertise and investments
- Need for cloud-agnostic container orchestration
- Complex container networking and service mesh requirements
- Applications designed specifically for Kubernetes APIs

**Considerations**
- More complex than ECS but more portable
- Requires Kubernetes knowledge and operational expertise
- Higher operational overhead compared to ECS Fargate
