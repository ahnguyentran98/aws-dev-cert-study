# AWS CLI, SDK, IAM Roles & Policies - Summary

## **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- **Purpose**: Tool to interact with AWS services using command-line commands
- **Features**: 
  - Direct access to AWS public APIs
  - Script development for resource management
  - Open-source alternative to AWS Console
- **Authentication**: Uses Access Keys (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key)

## **AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)**
- **Purpose**: Language-specific libraries for programmatic AWS access
- **Supported Languages**: JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++
- **Types**: Standard SDKs, Mobile SDKs, IoT Device SDKs
- **Integration**: Embedded within applications

## **IAM Roles**
- **Purpose**: Grant permissions to AWS services to perform actions on your behalf
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - EC2 Instance Roles
  - Lambda Function Roles
  - CloudFormation Roles
- **Best Practices**:
  - Each service should have its own role
  - Use least-privileged principle
  - Don't reuse roles across applications

## **IAM Policies Structure**
- **Components**:
  - **Version**: Policy language version ("2012-10-17")
  - **Statement**: Individual permission statements
  - **Effect**: Allow or Deny
  - **Action**: Specific AWS service actions
  - **Resource**: AWS resources the actions apply to

## **Policy Types**
- **AWS Managed**: Maintained by AWS, updated automatically
- **Customer Managed**: Created by you, version controlled, reusable
- **Inline**: One-to-one relationship with principal, deleted with principal

## **Authorization Model**
- **Evaluation Order**:
  1. Explicit DENY → Final decision: DENY
  2. ALLOW exists → Final decision: ALLOW  
  3. Default → DENY

## **Cross-Account Access**
- Uses **AWS STS (Security Token Service)**
- **AssumeRole API** for temporary credentials
- Credentials valid for 15 minutes to 1 hour

## **Security Tools**
- **IAM Credentials Report**: Account-level report of all users and credential status
- **IAM Access Advisor**: User-level service permissions and last access times

## **Best Practices**
- Don't use root account for daily operations
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Use groups for permission management
- Enable MFA and strong password policies
- Regular key rotation and access auditing
- Never share IAM users or Access Keys
