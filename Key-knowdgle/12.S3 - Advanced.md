# Amazon S3 Advanced - Summary

## **S3 Storage Classes & Lifecycle Management**
- **Storage Class Transitions**: Move objects between classes based on access patterns
  - Standard → Standard-IA (60+ days) → Glacier (6+ months) → Deep Archive
- **Lifecycle Rules**:
  - **Transition Actions**: Automatically move objects between storage classes
  - **Expiration Actions**: Delete objects after specified time periods
  - **Scope**: Apply rules by prefix or object tags
  - **Cleanup**: Delete incomplete multipart uploads and old versions

## **S3 Versioning & Replication**
- **Versioning**: 
  - Enabled at bucket level
  - Protects against accidental deletes
  - Each file modification creates new version
- **Replication**:
  - **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Compliance, lower latency
  - **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: Log aggregation, test environments
  - Requires versioning enabled on both buckets
  - Only new objects replicated after enabling
  - No chaining between replications

## **S3 Performance Optimization**
- **Baseline Performance**: 3,500+ PUT/DELETE, 5,500+ GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix
- **Multi-Part Upload**: 
  - Recommended for files >100MB, required for >5GB
  - Enables parallel uploads for faster transfers
- **Transfer Acceleration**: Uses CloudFront edge locations for faster uploads
- **Byte-Range Fetches**: Parallel downloads by requesting specific byte ranges
- **S3 Select**: Server-side filtering using SQL to reduce data transfer

## **S3 Event Notifications**
- **Trigger Events**: ObjectCreated, ObjectRemoved, ObjectRestore, Replication
- **Destinations**: Lambda, SQS, SNS
- **Advanced Option**: EventBridge for complex filtering and multiple destinations
- **Use Cases**: Generate thumbnails, trigger workflows, data processing

## **S3 Analytics & Monitoring**
- **Storage Class Analysis**: 
  - Helps decide optimal storage class transitions
  - Works for Standard and Standard-IA only
  - Generates daily reports with recommendations
- **S3 Analytics**: Provides insights for lifecycle rule optimization

## **S3 Access Management**
- **Pre-signed URLs**: 
  - Temporary access to objects (up to 7 days)
  - Inherits permissions of URL generator
  - Use cases: Premium content, temporary uploads
- **S3 Access Points**:
  - Simplify security management at scale
  - Each access point has own DNS and policy
  - Can be VPC-origin for private access
- **S3 Object Lambda**: Transform objects during retrieval using Lambda functions

## **Advanced Features**
- **S3 Select & Glacier Select**: SQL queries for server-side data filtering
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enable web browser access from different origins
- **Static Website Hosting**: Host static websites directly from S3 buckets
