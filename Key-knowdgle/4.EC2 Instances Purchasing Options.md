## **Overview of Purchasing Options**

EC2 offers 8 different purchasing options to suit various workload requirements and cost optimization needs:

- **On-Demand Instances** – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- **Reserved Instances** (1 & 3 years) – long workloads  
- **Convertible Reserved Instances** – long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plans** (1 & 3 years) – commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- **Spot Instances** – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- **Dedicated Hosts** – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Dedicated Instances** – no other customers will share your hardware
- **Capacity Reservations** – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
